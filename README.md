# 📑Algorithm & Problem Solving Repo📑

# 🎯Goals🎯

- To improve `PS Capabilities`
- To improve understanding of `Algorithm`
- To systematically mange `Algorithm & Problems`


# How to proceed
- prefix rules
    -  {platform abbreviation}_{problem identifiable number} 
- Create the source file in the Root Repo and write the code.
- Once solved the problem, move it to the directory for that day.


# 🚥Rules🚥

## ⌚How it goes
- Learning based on `이것이 취업을 위한 코딩 테스트다 with Python`
- PS is based on `Baekjoon OJ` and `Programmers` or `:LeetCode`
- Problems will be solved by `Python` & `Java`
  - Python Version : `3.11.*` - based on Leetcode
  - Java Version : OpenJDK 21 - based on Leetcode

## 📄Upload Convention

- Algorithm Study Name: `Algorithm/{Algorithm}`
- PS File Name: `ProblemSolving/{Platform}/Problem #}/`
- If the number of problems to be solved increases, divided by algorithm.
- `YY/MM/DD` is the only way for Commit message
